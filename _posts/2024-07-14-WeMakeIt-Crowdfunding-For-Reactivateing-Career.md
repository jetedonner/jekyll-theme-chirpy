_WeMakeIt - Reactivate my career_


# WeMakeIt - Reactivate my career ðŸš€
After more than 3 years at the social welfare office, I would like to get back into the primary labor market and make my contribution to society. I would like to give courses in the field of "artificial intelligence" for beginners and I have already started a website for presentation and registration. However, I noticed that my old laptop can no longer keep up with the new technology and so I would like to buy a new MacBook Air that meets the requirements. Unfortunately, the social welfare office cannot support me with this and that is why I became aware of "wemakeit.com". My goal is to get enough capital together for a new MacBook Air 2024 so that I can then complete the website for the presentation of the AI course, experiment with AI myself and also run the course.

## AI basics need more than "just a website"
In order to deal with AI myself and train an AI myself and so on, I need a powerful computer. I think this is the only real way to give my students a real impression of how an AI works, is trained and created. Here, I realized, my old laptop is no longer sufficient. I have too little storage space, too little RAM, too little GPU power, etc. That is why I started this crowdfunding project. ... Help me to get back into the job market and make a living for myself.

## Realization and implementation of AI course / re-entry into the first labor market
The money for this project will be invested entirely in the purchase of a new MacBook Air 2024 and will therefore be used to complete and refine the project fundamentals for the AI courses for beginners that I would like to give. By financing a new MacBook, you will enable me to re-enter the first labor market and thus break free from the social welfare office. I see myself as having a self-determined future and no longer being dependent on the social welfare office.
