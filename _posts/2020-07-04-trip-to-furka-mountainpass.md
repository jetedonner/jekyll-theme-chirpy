## Introduction
One of my most loved hobbies is to express my feelings through painting on canvas. I have digitalized some of my drawings and created a small website to display them to the public. Here you see a short subset of some of them. If you're interessed in more you can visit <https://art.kimhauser.ch> where you can see all of my digitalized paintings.
