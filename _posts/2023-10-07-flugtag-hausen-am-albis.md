## Introduction
Today was the anual model flight show of the model flight club Affoltern Am Albis in Hausen Am Albis. Hundreds of interested model flight enthusiasts, along with my uncle and me, went to the airfield in Hausen Am Albis early this Saturday morning to witness the spectacle. And we weren't disappointed, the show was, in short, unique.
