- [legaleskokain.kimhauser.ch - "Legalization of small amounts of cocaine for personal use"](https://legaleskokain.kimhauser.ch){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

# legaleskokain.kimhauser.ch - Petition - What is it about?
The consumption of cocaine by adult addicts is already legal in many Swiss cities in so-called contact and drop-in centers.
However, everything else, such as production/import, trade, possession, etc., is prohibited and punishable by law. This creates a gray area that is unacceptable. We want to change that. Help us!

## Breaking the power of the cartels - fighting the black market
One driver for an increase in consumption is certainly the overproduction of the cartels, who are trying with all their might to open up new markets. Prohibition has failed. Huge quantities of cocaine are being pushed onto the European market. The consumers most affected are at the mercy of the South American cartels and dealers. If we want to break the inhumane arbitrariness of the black market, sooner or later we will have to deal with regulation.

## Division into legal and illegal addictive substances
I believe that an adult should have the freedom to decide when to consume which substances. The vast majority do so without becoming addicted. That is something that needs to be acknowledged. Between fifteen and thirty percent of those who consume become addicted. Alcohol is the most harmful substance, tobacco is considered to be the substance with the greatest addictive potential. The current division into legal and illegal is not justified.

## International hurdles - cultivation, import and trade
In order to effectively combat the black market, cultivation and production would have to be legalized in addition to trade and consumption. But the illegal business is now organized globally, from cultivation in Colombia or Bolivia to small-scale dealers in Switzerland. The decriminalization of cultivation, trade and consumption would have to be addressed at an international level. Unfortunately, the agreements are still very much committed to the doctrine of the "war on drugs" and urgently need to be adapted.

## Goals of the petition and website
**Decriminalize**
Addicts (with low incomes) should not be punished but protected. A legal forum is needed

**Relieve the burden on the executive**
Relieve the burden on the police so that they can focus on other problems. Taxes can be levied.

**Uniform solution** 
There is a need for uniform laws throughout Switzerland that consistently solve the problem from start to finish

## Realization and implementation of AI course / re-entry into the first labor market
The money for this project will be invested entirely in the purchase of a new MacBook Air 2024 and will therefore be used to complete and refine the project fundamentals for the AI courses for beginners that I would like to give. By financing a new MacBook, you will enable me to re-enter the first labor market and thus break free from the social welfare office. I see myself as having a self-determined future and no longer being dependent on the social welfare office.
