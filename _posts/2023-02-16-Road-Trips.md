# Road Trips
Some impressions of my private excursions and road trips together with my colleagues and friends.

## 2023-02-16 Ski-Trip to Hoch-Ybrig
This winter we - a highly motivated group of friends from K&A Selnau Zürich - went on a trip to Hoch Ybrig where we took a day off to refresh and proof our skiing and snowboarding skills. This day was near to perfect as the conditions were just right. The weather was great, the people where nice, cool and hungry for skiing, there was plenty of snow - everywhere and the whole trip was payed by the social department of the city of Zürich. So what should I say more? Just watch the first draft of the video trailer I made. We are just about to gather all media (Images and Movies) together to produce a more advanced Trailer about the trip so you get a broader impression about the pack and the day.
