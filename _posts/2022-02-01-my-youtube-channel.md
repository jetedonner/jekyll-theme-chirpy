For some of my projects I have created online movies which most of them are available on my youtube channel and other platforms or my own website. Here you have an overview of the publicly available online movies from and/or featuring me as actor and/or as narrator.

## 006,9 - James Blond (Hunt for Urinella)
This is the outcome of a video project we did with some girls and boys in a summer camp back in autumn 1998. For non Swiss people: "Uriella" (Erika Hedwig Bertschinger-Eicke - Wiki, † 24. Februar 2019) was one of the most entertaining cult leaders in the world ... one of a kind. She was usually busy selling her urine as medicine, predicting the future of everything and everyone and such things. But we imagined what it would be like if she would aim for bigger things - like destroying the planet by using giant magnets and iron meteorites.

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
