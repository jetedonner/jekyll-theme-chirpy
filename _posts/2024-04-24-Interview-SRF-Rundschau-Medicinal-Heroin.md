## Synopsis
Drug distribution under criticism: When heroin substitutes are dealt
A liberal dispensing practice of heroin substitutes is considered an achievement in Swiss drug policy. Research now shows that the trade in diaphine, the pharmaceutically produced heroin, is apparently flourishing in Zurich. The addiction patients receive the tablets from the distribution points - since the Corona period, also in larger quantities. Addicts no longer have to fetch their substances every day, which makes life easier for many. But the report shows that abuse poses dangers.

## My life with psychoactive substances
I'm living as a polytoxicomamaniac with nicotin, heroin, cocain, alcohol, weed as well as many other substances for over 25 years now. I have been successfully working many years beside my consumption of substances and still I do so. This "dark" side of me is a inherent part of my life. If I would say "I want to change it or quit" I would lie - first to myself - and then to you. It gives me the serenity to accept life on this planet as it is and to accept my fellow human beings as they are. I helps me to relax as well as focus on what is important.

It is something that I have for myself, something that belongs to me alone and no one can take away from me. It helps me find my center.

## Interview Movie - SRF Rundschau Play
As part of a documentary on Swiss television SRF, I was able to give a few interviews and let the reporters spend a few days with me on the streets of Zurich. The focus of the documentary was on the topic of legal substitution of medicinal heroin in the ARUD in Zurich. And I had the chance to give some impressions on how the average life of a client of this program is. Check it out!
