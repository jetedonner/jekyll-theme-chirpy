Here you see a small overview of my publicly available 3D models - most of them are created with Blender and the source files are ready for for download and free to copy and extend as you need. All files are licensed on a "as is" basis and come with no warranty of any kind. But if you have any question, problem or feedback please feel free to contact me via <kim@kimhauser.ch> or visit <https://kimhauser.ch>

## Description
Suake3D is actually a variant of an app I often use to get familiar with a new technology or programming language I try to get into. It all started at programming school with the first variant of Suake where I was creating a clone of the well known game Snake which use to be preinstalled on all the early versions of the Nokia Mobile Phones. The goal and flow of the game is to steer a snake wich can grow when eating goodies around the screen without touching either the border or itself. The more goodies you eat the longer your snake gets and the faster it moves around the screen. You earn points with each goody you eat and enter a higher level after eating a certain amount of goodies.

## 3D Models
### Portal (Spinning)

_Fancy Teleporter Model_

This is basically a portal model I got from someone else. What I did was splitting the meshes and animating the "arms" so it spins around to give the impression of an animated teleporter in progress. You can download the Blender (\*.blend) file as well as the textures and a ready made FBX file. Check it out. Btw. this model is included in my UETeleportPlugin provided as a example portal.
