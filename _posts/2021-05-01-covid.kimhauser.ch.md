## Add Feedback
A small wizard like process leads you through the creation of a new feedback. You will have to pick a predefined topic and add your message with a email address attached from which you will have to confirm the addition of your feedback. This is to minimize the possibility and prevent fraudulent usage of the feedback assistant.
