## Description
The S4 Weather Station app makes use of the ambient sensors of the Samsung Galaxy S4 or Galaxy Note 3 and lets you take a snapshot with the camera of the smart devic together with an overlay of the ambient weather condition information. You can share the picture via Google+, Twitter and Facebook or just save it on the smart device. This version also has a basic gallery function. As of now the Samsung Galaxy S4 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 are the only two smart devices supporting all of the features of S4 Weather Station. Please give me feedback to <kim@kimhauser.ch> about the app and devices you got it running on. Thank you!
