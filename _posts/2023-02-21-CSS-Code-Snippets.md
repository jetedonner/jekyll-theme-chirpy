# CSS Code Snippets
Some small and simple code snippets from me.

## CSS (only) Floating Menu Button
This small snippet shows a CSS ONLY animated floating menu button. 

![Codepen of CSSOnly Floating Menu Button](../../assets/img/snippets/CSSOnly-Floating-Menu-Button-Codepen_2023-04-14.png){: width="333" height="462" }

The menu expands on hover and the burger icon of the menu button animates to an "X". No libraries are needed. JavaScript is needed only for setting the "active" state / CSS-Class to the menu, beside that no JS is needed and only pure CSS is used to render and animate this nice little menu.

Use and ammend the code as you like. The source is provided "AS IS" no warranty. The source is free for all your projects and plans whether it's' free or commercial. A reference to the author is highly appreciated.
