## Description
Suake3D is actually a variant of an app I often use to get familiar with a new technology or programming language I try to get into. It all started at programming school with the first variant of Suake where I was creating a clone of the well known game Snake which use to be preinstalled on all the early versions of the Nokia Mobile Phones. The goal and flow of the game is to steer a snake wich can grow when eating goodies around the screen without touching either the border or itself. The more goodies you eat the longer your snake gets and the faster it moves around the screen. You earn points with each goody you eat and enter a higher level after eating a certain amount of goodies.

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
