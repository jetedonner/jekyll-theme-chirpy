The `UE4 WeaponSysBase Plugin` provides you with many base classes and features to quickly and easily creating and implementing your own weapon system for your Unreal Engine Game

## Description
The "Weapon System Base" provides you with some very basic and useful classes and features to create your own Weapon System for a UE4 game. You'll find base classes for WeaponTypes, Weapons, Projectiles as well as hitable character and actor base classes, a floatable healthbar and also a dissolving material that you can use to destroy an actor on death. Just derive from the base classes and adjust the settings like Damage-Factor, Projectile-Speed, Ammo Count in inventory, Ammo Count in Clip, Clip Size, Firing Sound, Impact Sound, Impact Particle Effect, etc ... I strongly recommend you to download the sample project at "" to see how the Weapon System works and is implemented in a real game project.
