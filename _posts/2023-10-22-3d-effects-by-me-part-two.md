_WormHole Cinematic - (Red-Orange-Yellow)_

This is the sencond edition article of my endeavor in creating 3D Wormhole Effects with Blender 3.2.2. They are animated and available as .blend files (Source Files) as well as movie file version (.mp4) ready for download and usage. All files are licensed on a "as is" basis and come with no warranty of any kind and what so ever. (But) if you have any question, problem or feedback please feel free to contact me by e-mailing to <kim@kimhauser.ch> or visit <https://kimhauser.ch> and use the contact form


## Wormhole Effects - Blender only with a animated cylinder and modifiers
This is another Blender Project featuring a more realistic - almost cinematic - kind of wormhole effect. It's made with a cylinder attached to a skelleton which is animated whith some modifiers and such. The base camera captures the UV Warped Cylinder and its textures which use some shader effects. Check it out - you can download the rendered video file or the source Blender file and adjust the settings as you like and do with it anything you want.

## Wormhole Effects - Cinematic
### WormHole Effect - Cinematic with Blender (Red, Orange and Yellow, Seamless, Corrected!!!)
The first version of a cinematic wormhole using this new technique. Colored with a red, orange to yellow color theme. This version has a correction for the nasty seam in the static and procedural texturing so the seam is not visible anymore. Also a unwanted visible refraction effect showing up once and then was removed and the movie was re-rendered.
