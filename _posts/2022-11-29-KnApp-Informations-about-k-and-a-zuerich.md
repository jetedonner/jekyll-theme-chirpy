# KnApp - Project
KnaApp is a recent prototype I'm realizing and maintaining for a special section of the social departement of the city of zurich. The social departement provides a great and intensively used service called __Kontakt und Anlaufstelle__. This service aims to provide low-threshold offers to secure the life and survival of marginalized adults living in zurich.

The mobile App called _KnApp_ (in fact a responsive Website) provides basic information about the different K&amp;As in Zurich. These are opening hours, temporary closings, one on one situations, special hours, information about the meal service and todays menu, contact information (telephone, email and official website) and points out directions on Google-Maps as well as displaying recent news, it also features a feedback functionallity to leave your good or bad response as or lets you send suggestions or whishes to the team ... and more.
