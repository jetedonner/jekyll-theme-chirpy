## Synopsis
This post is a basic introduction for my journey into macOS executable reverse engineering with Ghidra and Lief. This article comes - beside the theoretical descritption - with a tutorial and example project which should provide you with the basic skills to start your own adventures in the land of macOS reverse engineering. Please keep in mind, that this topic is for informational and educational use only. Reverse engineering a copyright protected application might most likely be illegal in your country - depending on where you live.

## Problem description
Some times you might run in a situation where you want to be able to amend a existing exectuable on macOS and extend or edit its behavior.

## Description of macOS executable file format
### Mach-O file format description
Executables and libraries on macOS use the so called Mach-O file format. In this sections you will get infos about the structure of the Mach-O file format, how to do modifications and an introduction of some internal aspects of the format.

#### Mach-O file structure

## How to disassemble a macOS app

## Tools of trade
Here you have a list of (mostly) free tools which you need for file analysis, disassembling, debugging and modification. This list is by no means complete, but it should provide you with a basic overview of what comes handy when you seriously want to start reverse engineering macOS apps, executables and libraries. Please feel free to contact or send me an update for this list of tools when you think you have a important amendment / addition.

### Patching macOS app (with Ghidra)
For the tutorial about how to patch a macOS executable I use a small c app with a prompt asking the user to enter his secret and displays an appropriate message after checking the input. If the user doesn't enter the corret secret he will get an error. The goal of this tutorial is to patch the app in a way the user allways gets the success message, no matter if the secret is correct or not. We could also disable the whole prompt and check functionality, but for simplicity and for you to get the big picture, at this moment it's enough to just patch the check away. So let's dive in.

#### Create a simple app with C
Here you have my version of a simple app written with C and compiled on a MacBook Air M1 with Apple Silicon Chip (ARM64 Architecture).

##### Write the source file
Open your Text editor of choice (I use Sublime 3) and create a new file, copy paste the following source code and save the file as **"hello_world.c"**

#####Â Compile the source file to an executable
To compile the source code to an executable we use clang which is part of the "XCode command line tools" compilation. To check if clang is installed you can run:

```bash
dave@Aeon c % which clang 
/usr/bin/clang
```
If you get an error you might be missing the "XCode command line tools". Download XCode from the Apple App Store and / or use the following command in a terminal to install the "XCode command line tools"

```bash
dave@Aeon c % xcode-select --install
```
With clang installed you can use the following command in a terminal to compile the source "hello_world.c" into an executable. Notice: We create an executable with x86_64 architecture, more about that and why later. As you can see we have to include the "curses" library this is needed for the scanf() call.

```bash
clang -target x86_64-apple-macos -arch x86_64 -o hello_world hello_world.c -lcurses
```

```c
// Standard include
#include <stdio.h>
// For scanf()
#include <curses.h> 
// For strcmp()
#include <string.h>

int main() {

  // Variable to hold the user input
  char input[256];

  // The secret to check against the user input
  char hardcoded_string[] = "S3CR3T";

  // This msg will prompt the user to enter his / her secret
  printf("Please enter your secret: ");

  // Will wait for user input and store the input in the variable "input"
  scanf("%s", input);

  // Compare the value of the variable "input" with the variable "hardcoded_string"
  int result = strcmp(input, hardcoded_string);

  // If the compare of the two values succeeds (or not) show a appropriate message
  if (result == 0) {
    printf("#=========================================================#\n");
    printf("|                       SUCCESS !!!!                      |\n");
    printf("|                                                         |\n");
    printf("|      Welcome to the hidden spot of this app. Enjoy!     |\n");
    printf("|                                                         |\n");
    printf("#=========================================================#\n");
  } /*else if (result < 0) {
    printf("The input string is less than the hardcoded string.");
  } */ else {
    printf("#=========================================================#\n");
    printf("|                        ERROR !!!!                       |\n");
    printf("|                                                         |\n");
    printf("|       The entered secret does not match, try again      |\n");
    printf("|                                                         |\n");
    printf("#=========================================================#\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

```bash
dave@Aeon dev % clang -target x86_64-apple-macos -arch x86_64 -o hello_world hello_world.c -lcurses
...
dave@Aeon dev % chmod u+x hello_world
...
dave@Aeon dev % codesign --verbose=4 --timestamp --strict --options runtime -s "<YOUR SIGNING CERTIFICATE NAME>" hello_world --force

dave@Aeon dev % ./hello_world
Please enter your secret: Test
