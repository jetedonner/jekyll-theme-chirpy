Here you'll find 3D Effects created - most of them with Blender 3.2.2 - by me. They are animated and available as .blend files as well as movie version ready for download. All files are licensed on a "as is" basis and come with no warranty of any kind. But if you have any question, problem or feedback please feel free to contact me via <kim@kimhauser.ch> or visit <http://kimhauser.ch>
