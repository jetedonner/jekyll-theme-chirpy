## Introduction
One of my most loved hobbies is to express my feelings through painting on canvas. I have digitalized some of my drawings and created a small website to display them to the public. On this page here you have a short subset of some of them. If you're interessed in more you can visit <http://art.kimhauser.ch> where you can see all of the digital copies of my paintings.

_Yet very simple but one of my favourites_
