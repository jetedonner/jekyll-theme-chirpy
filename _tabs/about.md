## My story
kimhauser.ch is a small IT business based in Zurich - Switzerland. I'm passionate about finding high quality but yet easy to use and economic solutions for my customer's complex challenges.

> Just as the saying: "Don't shoot sparrows with cannons" I try to find the perfect concept for your software solution. I choose the optimal platform, API, language, tools, and setup for your project's requirements. Your quality requirements, price, and time budgets are my main focus while conception. Development takes place with ongoing and close feedback and quality control with you as my project partner. 

## My Services
### Broad experience in a wide spread field of software engineering topics
I can look back at a widespread field of different successful software projects in various areas. I develop for all major platforms and use the latest frameworks and APIs.
